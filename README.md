# DrawHere

My first android app - A simple drawing app that let's you draw pictures with your finger, supports eraser and fill tools, allows you to undo the last 3 changes made as well as giving you the option to uplad an image to the drawing.

Limitations/Thing being worked on:
- Create landscape version of app
- Add support for larger screen sizes / tablets (7 inch +)
- Increase undo limit from 3
- Add support for uploading multiple images
- Improved image maniputlation tools
