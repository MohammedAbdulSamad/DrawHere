# DrawHere

My first android app - A simple drawing app that let's you create drawings with your finger, supports eraser and fill tools, allows you to undo the last 3 changes made as well as giving you the option to uplad an image to the drawing.

Limitations/Thing being worked on:
- Create landscape version of app
- Add support for larger screen sizes / tablets (7 inch +)
- Increase undo limit from 3
- Add support for uploading multiple images
- Improve image maniputlation tools

Once a couple of finishing touches are applied, i will be looking into uploading the app to Google Play Store.

Some Preview Screenshots (Not Final):
